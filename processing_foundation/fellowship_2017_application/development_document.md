### Process of developing project
In a previous stage of the project, even before the publication of fellowship results, schools and institutions receiving workshops will be committed for starting workshops in March as long as the fellowship is assigned (why March? Because in Chile summer vacations are on January and February).
After the fellowship assignment, workshop classes will be designed during February, following p5.js documentation available on Processing Foundation’s web sites.
The process of learning .js and p5.js is planned from the scratch, leading the students to get acquainted with programming logic and basic p5.js functions. Afterwards is expected the exploration of RGB color management, mouse-position functions and more complex drawing shapes. It’s expected to lead students learn more complex coding structures as arrays or objects.

### Timeline of work and availability

The project will consist in 6 12-hours long workshops, divided into 6 classes each one. Each 2-hours class requires 0.5 hours for blogging. My availability for leading the project is on Thursdays (evenings), Fridays (mornings) and Saturdays (mornings), excepting for third and fourth February weeks.
Workshops will be designed during February.
Workshops will be setted up one on Thursday evening, one on Friday morning and one on Saturday morning, from Thursday March 9th to Saturday May 27th.
