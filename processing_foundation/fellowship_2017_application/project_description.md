### Project Description

## What I'm going to do

I will organize coding workshops aimed to lead Chilean high school students to discover coding skills through experiencing artistic and creative explorations by learning p5.js. This goal will be developed in 2 or 3 public high schools of Chile, with students between 15 - 17 years old. It’s important to remark that public education in Chile doesn’t consider coding as a fundamental topic, so those students aren’t able to learn how to code until they learn in college, at 19 - 20 years old. 

## How I'm going to do it

I will organize 6 workshops of 12 hours, each one of them with a maximum quota of 8 students, which will be carried out in 2 or 3 schools. Workshop’s strategy will consist in motivational speeches aimed to present exciting experiences in p5.js and transfer basic knowledge of .js, which will be applied in an exploratory way for the students.

## Why I am qualified for the project

I have more than 8 years experience in coding in languages as C, Java and .js. Also I have taught electronics as fellow teacher in two Chilean universities for the last 6 years. Currently I’m user of Processing and p5.js. Finally I think I'm qualified because I think introducing youth into coding is a fundamental goal in a country where this skill is no considered at all on youth learning.

## The project’s expected results

The expected results are: 1) lead the students to develop their first coding skills, 2) lead the students to learn basic .js skills which allows them to learn p5.js, and 3) lead the students to explore their creative world by using p5.js. Each workshop will be properly documented by visual and audiovisual recording (if applicable) and blog update. Each workshop will be finished with a exposition of media projects developed by the students.

## How my project will expand the possibilities of Processing

This project aims to introduce young students in programming skills by learning p5.js. In that way the project pretends to develop new audiences for Processing Foundation softwares based on Chilean public high schools. This project - if successful -  can be the first step of a wide program of digital alphabetization or programming learning leaded to Chilean youth, in which Processing Foundation can play a fundamental role.
